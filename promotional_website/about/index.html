                <p>Currently, Utah charter middle schools face the substantial problem of scheduling their students, teachers, courses, and classrooms. School Management Systems within their budgets do not even attempt a solution, and this can be a daunting task to accomplish by hand. SchoolBloc resolves this issue by utilizing a powerful solving engine and a friendly user interface.</p>
                <br>
                <p>SchoolBloc interfaces with a popular School Management System by importing the lists of teachers, students, classrooms and courses. The administrator can then apply constraints to the relationships between each of these objects.  For example, teachers can be scheduled to teach a given course in a given classroom. When finished, the scheduler engine searches the solution space for a schedule that meets all of the user provided constraints. The completed schedule information is then imported into the School Management System. SchoolBloc was developed with the collaboration of the Utah charter school, Vangard Academy, who plans to use SchoolBloc as their scheduling solution in future semesters.</p>
